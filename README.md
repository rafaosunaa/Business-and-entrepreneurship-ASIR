# Business and entrepreneurship
 Final Project for the Course "Business and Entrepreneurial Initiative"  In this project, I have developed a proposal for the hypothetical establishment of “BOSS,” a nightclub-pub in the city center of Córdoba. The venue aims to cater to a young to middle-aged audience, featuring two distinct areas for lively partying and a more relaxed atmosphere.
